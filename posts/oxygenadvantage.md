Talking about the book "The Oxygen Advantage"

## The Oxygen Advantage: Understanding the Benefits of Proper Breathing

In this article, I will be discussing the book "The Oxygen Advantage" and summarizing its key points. Additionally, I will be providing exercises and tips for improving your breathing.

## About the Book:
"The Oxygen Advantage" is a book that emphasizes the natural way of breathing for humans. One of the crucial points it makes is the importance of breathing through the nose. Breathing through the mouth can cause dryness, loss of moisture, and make us more vulnerable to viruses. On the other hand, nose breathing is 42% healthier. The book also highlights one of the biggest modern-day problems: breathing too much.

## Breathing Too Much:

Most people don't realize that breathing too much is a significant issue. A natural breathing rhythm should involve 8-10 breaths of 0.5l per minute. However, many people take 10-15 breaths of 1l per minute, and for individuals with asthma or during exercise, these numbers can go even higher. This unhealthy breathing pattern results in a significant loss of CO2, which is a vital chemical needed to process oxygen effectively. Instead, we should train our bodies to take in oxygen more efficiently by taking small, light breaths through our nose and breathing with our belly instead of our chest.

## High Altitude Training:

High altitude training is an effective way to produce important chemicals that aid in oxygen intake. During high altitude training, the oxygen content of your blood decreases, forcing your body to become more productive with less oxygen. This leads to the production of EPO (Erythropoietin), which helps to take in oxygen 30% more effectively. You can simulate high altitude circumstances in your body by using "breath breaks."

## Exercises:

One exercise you can do is to test your BOLT score, which measures your breathing efficiency. To take the test, breathe a little bit, and then exhale through your nose. Pinch your nose with your hand to prevent air from entering your lungs and count how many seconds until you feel like you need to breathe. Repeat this a few times and take the average of the seconds you can hold your breath as your BOLT score.

Another exercise to improve your BOLT score involves sitting straight with one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale small breaths, and focus on feeling your belly grow as you breathe in. Then, practice putting pressure against your chest and belly, limiting your ability to breathe deeply. Breathe in against your hands, taking smaller and smaller breaths. Repeat this exercise daily, and you could see an increase of 8-10 seconds in your BOLT score in 2-3 weeks.

## Conclusion:

I hope you found this article informative and that it inspires you to explore the benefits of proper breathing. You can buy the book here: https://amzn.to/3LhO6hz or check it out from your local library. For more information and contact with the author's team, visit https://oxygenadvantage.com/.

## Quote:
I would like to end with a quote from Franklin Roosevelt:

### "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."
This quote speaks to the importance of not letting our daily worries cloud our vision and to have faith in our ability to achieve our goals.
