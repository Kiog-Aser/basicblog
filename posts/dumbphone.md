The reason I switched from a smartphone to a dumbphone

## I switched to a dumbphone

I switched to a dumbphone and in this post I will explain why. I still have a smartphone (without a simcard) which I still have to use for certain apps. However my 'main' phone is the Nokia 6300 now, a feature phone with whatsapp.

## Mental Health

One of the reasons I switched is because of mental health benefits. Our smartphones are designed to keep us distracted and constantly engaged with their apps and ads. They are simply products made to make them money. We constantly are distracted and pushed with notifications, this is a big reason why modern focus time has become so short. However when using a dumbphone it's way more peacefull and calm, no endless distraction, just you're basic functions and features. Our smartphones and mostly social media are made to get us spending more time using these apps. They make them as addictive as possible, this way they make more money. However, these apps are worst then most people think for us, there have been some studies, but we really don't understand how bad they are. They simply f*ck up our mental health and most of us even know this. or at least have a feeling they are not healthy.

## Focus

Another reason I switched was to become more focussed on the most important tasks in my life. I didn't want to constantly be distracted by useless content. I wanted to be able to focus on tasks, friends and family around me.

## That's it!

I know I didn't post for some weeks, that was because I had exams. Now I have time and energy to start posting again weekly and this was a small post to begin with.

## Quote

This weeks quote is:

### "The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but reveal to them their own."
~ Benjamin Disraeli

I guess we should help instead of share? What do you think?

I hope you enjoyed this post and learned something, thank you for reading and have a great day!
