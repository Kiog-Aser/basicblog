## Introduction

We all have big dreams we would love to turn into reality. But we all know it's not easy to turn those big dreams into reality. In this blog I will show you have you can set good goals to achieve those dreams. You will learn what a good goal is, how to set them and how to accomplish them.

## What is a good goal?

It's important to set good goals, otherwise we might not see the best results. A good goal should be challenging, but not impossible. It should have a deadline (for example be able to do 12 pull ups within 3 months) and it should help you towards bigger goals and your dreams. You can add some action you will do after the deadline to proof you completed your goal, like talking in a language with a native speaker for 3 minutes if you want to learn a language.

**SMART Goals** 

We can set our goals using the SMART protocol. A goal should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound. 

## How to set goals?

Now it's time to set those goals using the SMART protocol. The first thing you want to do is think about your dreams for some time. Then take a paper and write down your long-term dreams (aim for one for Relationships, one for Health, one for Wealth, and one Bonus for your own personal growth). Now with those written down you can start to think of short term (3-12 months) goals to get closer to those dreams. Write down at least 4 goals in total (1 for each long term goal/dream) with a time period in which you will complete them. Now start to write steps for getting towards your goals and begin by following those steps and taking note of your progress.

## Keep going

Now the most important thing is to stay consistent and keep going. In order to achieve big goals, you have to put in big effort and stay consistent with it. Even when you don't feel motivated, keep going and push yourself. You can't expect to achieve all your goals super fast, it's a long process and it takes effort and consistency.

## Conclusion

In the pursuit of turning our grand dreams into tangible realities, the journey begins with setting the right goals. We've explored the essence of what constitutes a good goal and how to structure them using the SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Your dreams are the seeds from which these goals sprout. By taking a moment to reflect on your aspirations across different facets of life—Relationships, Health, Wealth, and your own personal growth—you lay the foundation for meaningful change. Setting short-term goals aligned with these dreams and committing to a time frame gives you direction and purpose.

However, the true test lies in the persistence to keep moving forward. Achieving substantial goals demands unwavering dedication, especially during times when motivation wanes. Consistency and sustained effort are the bridges that connect your dreams with reality. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither are your dreams. It's a journey, marked by progress and persistence, that ultimately leads to the fulfilment of your most ambitious aspirations. So, keep pushing, stay consistent, and embrace the adventure of achieving your dreams one goal at a time.
