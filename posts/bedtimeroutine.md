## What is a bedtime routine?
It's just like a morning routine, where you always do certain things in the morning when you wake up. The same thing can happen at night before you go to sleep. **This will help you're body to recognise that you are going to sleep soon and then your body will make the right sleeping hormones.** I will explain my routine, give some examples for you and show you how to set up a routine.

## My routine
Okay, let's start by showing you my routine.
First things first, it's important to have a **consistent sleeping rhythm**. I suggest you go to sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 6:30-7:30 am. This works for me, it's easy and sustainable. Now let's dive into my routine:

9 pm - 9:45 pm: **I read** (educative books, not bs stories)

9:45 pm - 9:50 pm: **I drink a cup of hot milk** (I will explain why later.)

9:50 pm - 9:55 pm: **I prepare to sleep** (brush my teeth, etc)

9:55 pm - 10 pm: **I stretch**

10 pm: **I go to bed** and I read for about 15 more minutes in bed, try to do some breathing exercises/meditation and make a list of what I will do tomorrow.

## Why do these things (and are their alternatives)?
Now let's break down each step and why I do it.
Reading is pretty easy, to learn and develop myself. I also have some other posts about books I like, so go check them out!
A cup of hot milk? Yes, I only recently learned this, but hot milk with a bit of honey helps you sleep better. It does that by increasing a certain hormone named serotonin. This hormone has a very calming effect and is released after drinking hot milk.
No need to explain preparing to sleep :) (always brush your teeth, etc)
Stretching is important and very good. I do struggle with stretching consistently.
The last step is just to really end the day and make my eyes a bit tired so I fall asleep quicker, and to start tomorrow successfully.

**Alternatives?**
Here are some alternatives to my routine you can do/implement.
Take a **cold shower**, it really knocks you down and makes you very tired. (I do one in the morning and sometimes in the evening). Of course, you can take 15 minutes to **meditate**, we all know how good it is (I recommend trying the Wim Hof breathing technique). You could also **journal** a bit about your day. Lastly, you could **visualise** for some time. Visualisation is a very powerful tool to increase happiness and overall life.

## How to start
Now let's break down how you can start and make your own routine.
I recommend you make a routine of at least **30 minutes** before you go to sleep.
Then to fill in those 30 minutes you just pick out the activities you would like to do daily before you go to sleep. It is important to stick with the same activities because doing those activities will trigger your body to go into **"sleep mode"**.
Then the most important thing is just to stay consistent!
