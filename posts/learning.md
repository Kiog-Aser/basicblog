## Introduction

Have you ever heard the quote "all I know is that I know nothing"? Well, in this blog post I will talk about the importance of constantly learning and improving. You will learn about benefits of constant learning and some strategies to keep learning.

## Why we should learn

Why should we always be learning? Why is it so important to grow our knowledge? Have you ever really needed or missed crucial knowledge?
We should learn to improve ourselves as persons, to train our brain, and to enjoy learning new things. It's always fun to read about something interesting and learn about new topics. If it's fun and useful, why not do it on a daily basis. 

## How to implement learning

How could we implement a new learning habit into our daily lives?

Here are some ideas:

**Reading**

Read at least 30-60 minutes per day. Try to aim for at least one book per week. In order to stay consistent with this, try to read at the same time and place every day.

**Watching podcasts**

Another way to learn is by watching podcasts. Find a podcast you like about a topic you like and try to watch 1 or 2 episodes every week. Here are some of my recommendations: **Huberman lab** (https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab), DOAC (https://www.youtube.com/@TheDiaryOfACEO), Jay Shetty Podcast (https://www.youtube.com/@JayShettyPodcast.) and the Ed Mylett Show (https://www.youtube.com/@EdMylettShow).

**Learning a new skill/language**

The next thing you can do is learn a new skill or language. I am learning Spanish for example. Try to take 30 minutes per day to develop a new skill or learn a language, There are more than enough free tools to learn things online.

## Conclusion

We can conclude that it's important to keep learning. We can implement a daily learning habit using multiple strategies, including something like reading.
## Quote

Let's end with this quote:
