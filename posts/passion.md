A couple years ago everyone talked about finding passion, where are they now?
## Just a couple years ago

I remember about two or three years ago, everyone was talking about finding your passion. All the 'guru's talked about it and said they found their passion. Weirdly enough, they all had the same passion: help people. And so they all travelled the world, helping people in the same time. But after some time, it got quite, and the talks about passion disapeared.

## What happened?

Now what did actually happen? I don't know. But, I do have an idea. I think that it was one big marketing stunt, and mostly a trend on the internet which content creators used to go viral. I don't think that they actually found their passion, I think they were being sold that passion. At the end of the day, everyone's passion seems to be helping others, at least on the internet. 

## Purpose

I don't think passion is the way to follow, it think your passion also changes a lot. I think that you should rather follow your purpose, and your passion will shift towards that purpose. Purpose consists of layers, and for each layer you may find a different passion.
