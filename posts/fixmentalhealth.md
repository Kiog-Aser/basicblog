How you can fix your mental health and start living a more purposeful, conscious life.
## Introduction

In this blog post I will show you easy to implement strategies and habits to improve your mental health starting today. If you want to see results, it's important to implement these things and not just read them. 

## Remove distractions

The first important thing to do is to remove (modern) distractions. This means drastically lowering the amount of time you spend on the internet. If you are really serious, buy a dumb phone instead of a smartphone. If you do want to continue using your smartphone, always have air plane mode on and turn grey scaling on in your settings. In you PC/laptop you can block distracting sites, and remove irrelevant apps. Try to limit contact with over stimulation, let your mind rest.

## Remove music

The second thing you should do is to remove/limit music. Music is way to accessible and degenerate nowadays. You should try to listen less to music, and if you do listen to music, listen to music without any vocals. I wrote a full blog post about this here: https://blog.milh.tech/posts/nomoremusic/.

## Meditation

The next thing is daily meditation, or just breathing exercises. We all know that meditation helps to calm your mind and remove random impulses or thoughts. The peace it brings to your mind is very important to level up your mental health. Try to start today with a 5 or 10 minute meditation and keep it up for 1 week to start seeing some results. I can also recommend the Wim Hof breathing technique, it's amazing! 

## Cold therapy

Have you tried taking a cold shower or an ice bath? It can be really uncomfortable, but the results are amazing. It helps you calm down, but it's also a great way to level up your discipline. Try to take one cold shower every morning for one week and see some results. It's okay if you can't stay under the water for longer than a couple of seconds, this is a skill to level up. Slowly stay longer, until you can stay in the cold for 90 seconds.

## Embrace nature

It's been proven that seeing and being in nature, benefits your mental health. Just seeing trees, green and animals stimulates some natural reflexes.
Go outside daily, it's calming, fun and healthy. You could go on a daily walk, a run or something else you may like. Just go outside and enjoy every moment in nature.

## Sleeping rhythm

It's important to have a consistent sleeping rhythm. Wake up at one time and go to sleep at one time every day. You body loves this and you will feel more energised and less tired. I wake up at 6:30 am and go to sleep at 10 pm, this is a simple good rhythm you could try. 

## Gratitude

It's important to practice gratitude daily. You could start gratitude journaling. It's very easy, just write down 5 things you are grateful for every morning. You can implement this in your morning routine. This helps you change your mindset to become more grateful and positive in life.

## Exercising

You can combine this with being in nature. Take at least 30 minutes per day to exercise. This is healthy, fun, benefits your mental health and can help you train your discipline. 

## Healthy diet

Eat healthy. It's really important to keep your body healthy and eat the right things. Try to embrace intermittent fasting, and eat more healthy foods. These are foods like meat, nuts, berries and eggs. These are the main foods your body is build for. Reduce bad foods and increase good foods and you will see great results.
