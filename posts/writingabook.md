## Introduction

If you are new to this blog and this is the first time you are reading, let me quickly introduce myself and give some context. If you are not new, skip ahead to next part. I am Mil Hoornaert I am a 15 year old content creator (YouTube and blog) and I want to provide young men with valuable content to help them improve their lives. In this blog post I will explain why I am going to write a book, what it would be about and talk about the future of my blog. Before I start, I would like to quickly apologise for barely posting this summer. I was really busy and I found it hard to make some time free to write blog posts.
I do want to get back into a more consistent posting rhythm, at least once a week.

## Why would you write a book?

Excellent question! That's a question I should ask myself a bit more. I think mostly to help young men more by giving them all they need in one cheap and accessible book. This way I think I could really provide the best value. Besides that I am also looking for ways to improve my writing skills, because I think writing might be my **'flow state' activity.** That basically means, that I am barely thinking whilst doing that activity, and that probably means it is related to my **purpose**. I will most likely make a post on purpose so, I will explain that more their.

## What would the book be about?

Another great question, and I am still figuring that out for a big part. But I think it would probably be some kind of guide to life, going over the main aspects of life and how to improve those with actionable steps. It would be as valuable as possible and as accessible as possible so everyone could benefit from it.
I even think I will publish the e-book in chapters on my blog for free, because I don't really value e-books and I think that it would be beneficial for me and all readers.

## What about your blog?

Nothing different, I will try to stay consistent and keep posting my best possible articles, maybe sometimes it won't be as consistent or maybe sometimes it will be daily. I can't promise anything with certainty, but I will try my best.

## New blog design?

Yes! Thank you for noticing. In case you have never seen another design, this is a new blog design. I used to have a blog design with more pages and pictures for all my posts, now I am going for this minimalistic style. I wanted my blog to be easy and understandable, no complex design. This is a faster and simpler design. This way only people who want to read my post will read, not people who clicked on a cool image.

## Quote
As always, let's end with a quote.
