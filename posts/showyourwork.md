## Introduction

A quick introduction before I start. In this post I will breakdown the book **'Show Your Work!'** by Austin Kleon. I will cover the **key takeaways** from the book and my ideas. I will make different sections covering each point and try to make this the best I can. Hopefully you get the most out of this post, implement it and really improve your life with these strategies. (The sections will be the main chapters of the book)

## You don't have to be a genius

The first chapter is 'You don't have to be a genius'. In this part Austin explains that you should not try to make your work perfect. You should rather make good work and improve by doing so. It's important to be able to just start creating and sharing, and not to wait for the perfect idea and work. You can even **'steal'** other people's ideas. Look for **great ideas** around you and try to use those for inspiration or just **improve** those. **The main point is to produce your content, not to pretend to be someone else and to produce content. You can never find your own voice if you don't use it.** (Austin Kleon's words)

## Think in processes, not products

The second chapter is 'Think in processes, not products'. When an artist creates a piece of art, their are actually two pieces of art. One is the **visible/materialistic piece of art**, the other one is the **story behind the piece of art**. You should not focus on your product or visible/materialistic piece of art, rather **focus on your process of creating**. Enjoy creating and make the visible/materialistic piece of art a representation of your story and process. A process is a big mess, and that's the beauty about it!

## Share something small everyday

The third chapter is 'Share something small everyday'. That's pretty easy, right? Just share a piece of content everyday. You can take it really easy and just post a tweet everyday for example, or just a social media post (I don't recommend social media). Make sure that before you share something, you ask yourself the following question: **'Does it matter?'**. Answer that question by looking at different standpoints and thinking about how they would value your content. It's probably best to start your own blog or at least build a good (domain) name.

I will try to help as many people as possible with the basics of just getting started with blogging (I am not that advanced myself).

## Open up your cabinet of curiosities

The fourth chapter is 'Open up your cabinet of curiosities'.
**Become more curious to learn new things, and you will learn new things.**
You should always stay a student and try to learn as much as possible. The more curious you become in new things, the more new things you will explore and get to know. These experiences could be key in your creation of (great) content. Appreciate other creators and their work, and learn from them.

## Tell good stories

The fifth chapter is 'Tell good stories'.  To share your work it is important to **tell your stories**. Get better at telling your stories and share them with the people around you! Even at a party, you could be telling stories about your and your work. Here is **Dan Harmon's Story Cycle**:

## Teach what you know

The sixth chapter is 'Teach what you know'. **Share your knowledge** with people who need it for free, they need it. You can always do this and it helps others out. It even **helps you** because those people will remember your name. People will like your work and want to learn more.

## Don’t turn into human spam

The seventh chapter is 'Don’t turn into human spam'. **Share, but don't spam!** Only share good content (remember to ask **'Does it matter?'** before posting something), and don't spam out random crappy content. It's better to make 1 good post every week then 3 okay or bad posts per week.

**You want hearts, not eyeballs –** Stop caring about how many people read your stuff and how many people follow you online.

**The vampire test –** “Whatever excites you, go do it. Whatever drains you, stop doing it” – Derek Sivers. You might run into 'vampires' in your life, people who drain your energy without giving something in return. Avoid those people.

**Meet people IRL** – Make online friends, and then meet them in real life. Meet-ups are great. If you know someone online and you’re in the same town, grab a coffee with them. When you’re travelling, let your online friends know you’re going to be around.
## Learn to take a punch

The eighth chapter is 'Learn to take a punch'. People will **criticise** you and **disagree** with you. It's important to learn how to handle that criticism and improve with it. You need to be able to take a punch and get stronger after it. If you can't do that, you will probably miserably fail.

> Compulsive avoidance of embarrassment is a form of suicide. – Colin Marshall.
## Sell out

The ninth chapter is 'Sell out'.  It's okay to try and make some money, but do it smart. You want to sell your work, so don't sell yourself. Be the seller and passionate creator of your work. 

**Keep a mailing list –** Even if you don’t have anything to sell right now, keep a mailing list. There are people who run multimillion dollar businesses off their mailing lists. The model is simple – give away free great free stuff on your website. Collect the emails of people who enjoy reading it. When you have something remarkable to sell or share, send them an email letting them know.

**Pay it forward –** When you have success, help people who reach out to you. Help people who helped you get where you are.

**Caveat –** Don’t sacrifice your art or your work for the sake of answering emails. Be as generous as you can, but selfish enough to get your work done.
## Stick around

**Keep going** and keep creating! **Don't quit**, consistency is key!
