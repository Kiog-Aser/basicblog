## Introduction

I am reading two books, one about success (Tribe of Mentors by Tim Ferris) and one about zen (The Book of Nothing by Osho). In this blog I compare the books, look for similarities and the best parts of the books.

## Tribe of Mentors

The first book is Tribe of Mentors. In this book, Tim Ferris interviews some of the most successful people on the planet and asks each one of them 10 questions. They respond and the best answers he uses in his book. These questions go from "What are your favourite books?" to "What would you put on a giant billboard?". 

## The Book of Nothing

This book is about nothing, made of nothing and supposed to be nothing. It's simply nothing. "Nothing must be boring, right? No it isn't it is filled with Buddhas." The book finds the essence of a meaningful life through nothing and the power of nothing. 

*"Some people say you can measure life in breaths, so if you breath 4 times per minute instead of 12 you live longer."* 

## Similarities?

What's similar between advice from successful people and Zen-Buddhists?

Not a lot, but finding peace and calm is important. Clearing the mind of thoughts is key and needed for your daily life. Besides that both share wisdom and inspiring thoughts.

## A quote from both books

Let's take a look at a quote from both books:

**Tribe of Mentors:**

#### "Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want"

**The Book of Nothing:**

#### "Love is inhaling, hate is exhaling"

What do you think of these quotes?

Thank you for reading!
