## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how some people are able to tell such good stories? Or why you still remember a certain story from so long ago? In this blog post I will explain everything you need to know to be able to tell good stories. I followed a One Month course covering everything. If you want to check out the course yourself, go ahead: https://onemonth.refr.cc/milloranh.

## The three main components of a good story

Let's start with the basics. There are 3 big components for a good story.

**Human Beings**

The first important part is human beings. A good story should have human beings. Human beings make stories more natural and relatable. You can use made up characters or yourself for your stories.

**Emotional change**

The second important thing in a story is emotional change. A good story always has some sort of emotional change. This keeps people engaged and makes the story really hit them. 

**Controlling idea**

The third thing is a controlling idea or a point. Have you ever heard a story and thought "what's the point of this story?" or "where is this going?". Well, it's important to figure out that controlling idea or point before you tell your story. Let's take a better look at controlling ideas.

## Controlling ideas

How do you find your controlling idea? How do you use it? How do you build a story around it?

To find a controlling idea, you should do a little brainstorm. You controlling ideas should be a catchy sentence like "conquer your fears before they conquer you!". Come up with some ideas and then start to pick out the best ones. 

**Real-life events/experiences**

Once you have your controlling idea, think of a real-life event/experience you personally had around this controlling idea. Do a little brainstorm about this and find a couple of memorable and personal events. These events will be the main part of your story, you will build around them.

## Getting your first story together

Now you have the first building blocks for a good story. You should have a human being as your character, some emotional change and a controlling idea linked to a personal event/experience. Now all you have to do is get the puzzle pieces together. Start writing your story, and remember that the only way from here is forward! Your stories will gradually improve and get better overtime.

## Purpose stories

Now let's look at purpose stories. Purpose stories are stories where you had a click our eureka moment. Stories with a point that were crucial in your life. In (purpose) stories we need to take a look at two big factors. **Narrative Summary** and **Scenic Detail**.

**Narrative Summary**

Narrative summary is describing a situation, without using a lot of personal detail and not diving into the scenes a lot.

**Scenic Detail**

Scenic detail is describing a moment in your story very specific and make listeners or readers imagine it and feel it for themselves. You can do this by adding sound, smell, taste, sights, physical feelings and thoughts. You can go very specific, this makes stories more engaging and fun. 
## Stakes

All stories - at least all stories that are interesting and affecting - have **stakes**. The stakes are whatever is up for grabs, what the character in the story might win or lose. It could be a job, a friendship, a map to buried treasure written in invisible ink on the back of the US Constitution: anything that the hero values, hopes for, or fears falls under the category of 'stakes.' 

The trick to a story with good stakes is understanding what the protagonist really values, and putting them in a situation where those values might be tested or changed. When you're editing a story, do so with those turns in mind. Follow the emotion.

Here are some questions to find your stakes:

What's to be gained or lost?
What does the hero value, hope for, fear?
How do his/her feelings about that change?

## Relationships stories

Up next are relationship stories. These stories are where you gain someones trust and get someone to know you better.

**Ways to find good relationships stories**

Here are some questions that could lead to good relationships stories:

Was there a time where you had to introduce yourself to someone and make a good impression?

Is there an impression that people in your field often have of you?

Is there a person who's story inspires you?

Can you think of a time where interacting with someone in a slightly different way than usually made a difference?

What would you like to talk about with someone in an elevator for only 40 seconds?

## Narrative structure

Now let's take a look at the right structure for a good story.

A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end.

**Beginning**

In the beginning, you should start you story with a set-up and an inciting incident.

The **Set-Up** introduces someone, and their situation, what their deal is. The **Inciting Incident** then somehow affects that status quo, whether it's a tornado that carries you off to a magic land of Technicolor, or a taking your first drink at a party.

**Middle**

In the middle of your story, you have a rising action. 

With the **Rising Action** of our stories, incidents keep happening to the hero as they're on their journey to see the wizard or in the course of their drinking. These incidents get progressively more intense. It's good to choose about three of them, where you can really show how things are getting better/worse/more complicated. 

**End**

The Rising Action builds up to something, some sort of crisis or key moment. And that's our **Main Event**. From there, there's **Resolution**, where the controlling idea of the story is (re)stated, and we wrap up what happens to the main character.

## Possibility stories

Let's tackle what a possibility story is and why it's a good fit for business storytelling.

A **Possibility Story** is a story about _going somewhere_. It could be an origin story of how your business or brand got to where it is now, or how you plan on expanding in the next six months, and how you're going to achieve what you're going to achieve. They're great for business.

Possibility stories can take place over a longer stretch of time, so they might not be about just one incident or meeting. They likely have multiple steps, and all those steps may not have happened yet. So as you're thinking about them, break down the key steps you took or will take to get from the start of the story to its end.

## Additional strategies/info

Let's see some extra info and strategies for telling better stories!

**Duration of stories**

Some strategies for compressing or lengthening stories if you need to: 

- You can always prepare different versions of your stories for different lengths of time. 
- Stick to the most essential points. You can summarize scenes, or drop them entirely, as long as you're able to get across the controlling idea.
- Always keep in mind what you're trying to get at. Knowing that as you're speaking, you're proving a specific point, you'll be able to evaluate your story on how much each particular beat of it contributes to that point.

**Pitch and pacing**

There are a number of reasons why you might want to adjust your pitch and the pacing of your voice as you tell a story. The first is to engage with the audience. If you're dealing with a bored, sleepy, or antsy audience, being faster and louder may get them excited. If you're dealing with an audience that really needs time to weigh what you're saying, or to linger on certain points of your story, a slower pace might be more appropriate.   
  
There's also manipulations you can make based on the content of the story you're telling. If you're at a particularly dark moment, or if there's a surprise, or if it takes a turn - you can get all of that across through changes in your voice. 

As with everything, of course, the amount of expressiveness and theatricality you use depends on your audience and what you feel is appropriate. 

_Extra Notes:_

For the (somehow) uninitiated, check out Queen's [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ) for a perfect example of "vocal variety."

**Body movement**

Some tips for healthy body movement while you're on stage: 

- Practice good posture. 
- Root yourself, so that you're comfortable. 
- If you're a fidgeter, find a place in the story where it makes sense for you to move around and you can put your energy into the story where it's appropriate. 
- If you tend to stand still, again, find a place where it's appropriate to move around a little and make the story more dynamic.

**Vocal ticks and eye contact**

It's usually a good idea to try to make eye contact. Not with the same person in the audience the whole time, but to at least scan the room as you're talking. Look to the left and right _and_ center. Make sure people feel like you're talking to everyone in the room. 

Don't single out anyone who looks angry or bored. First, you can't actually know what they're thinking, so don't take it as a slight. What you can do is take it as encouragement to maybe get a little louder or more dynamic on stage. 

As regards vocal ticks, don't beat yourself up too much about whatever one you may have. You should notice yourself doing it, and by noticing it and being conscious of it, you'll start doing it less. But don't police yourself so rigorously. Just keep practicing.

**Feeling nervous**

It's **normal** to feel nervous. As you practice storytelling, or any other kind of public speaking, you can actually use your nerves and apply that energy into your storytelling. Just remember that you're nervous because you care about what you're doing. Once you do start talking, and see that people are listening to you, those nerves will almost inevitably subside.

**Making mistakes**

Mistakes happen. It's okay to acknowledge them. Just don't let them derail your story. You can make a joke, or get a colleague or the audience involved to smooth things over. You can treat it as a conversation, where mistakes definitely do happen. It's not a big deal. Acknowledge something, pivot, and move on.

**Asking questions**

Asking questions is a very effective way to set up a story, or express ideas inside a story. That technique works by engaging the audience and challenging them to imagine the answer to your question. You can also use them to point out changes to the room, and that in turns makes the audience more aware of the nature of what you're doing as conversation. It puts them with you.

**Preparing for a story**

How you should or shouldn't prepare your story in advance depends a lot on your personal preferences. It is generally not a good idea to try and memorize something word for word. That has a tendency to sound memorized, and that sound tends to turns people off. You also don't want to read word for word. It kills the connection you can have with your audience. 

It's perfectly okay to run your story for yourself or in front of your friends as many times as you need to. You can have notes, or use a little cheat sheet of words and phrases you know will get you back on track if you wander a bit. They can give you the gist of the idea you're trying to express. As you continue telling stories, both particular stories and stories in general, you'll get more comfortable with telling things off the cuff and even improvising.

**Not being prepared/improvising**

If you're speaking extemporaneously, before you start, take a moment to think of the two-three points you need to hit in order to tell your story properly. Visualize what's essential to your controlling idea. Know the place that you're going to start from, and where you're going to land. It's okay if you need to know your first line and your last line in advance. 

But then, once you start, let it flow. Aim for those points so that you have something of a structure to what you're saying, but don't be too rigid. See where conversation takes you.

**Visual aids**

Visual aids are often a good idea. A strong powerpoint or a whiteboard - like the one Kevin used throughout the workshop - can help illustrate (pun kind of intended) and emphasize what you're saying. They can anchor both you and the audience as you go.

The trick is that you don't want to ever be reliant on visual aids. You, your voice, should be the star of the storytelling experience. Your visual aids shouldn't be too distracting or dense, nor should they simply restate what you're saying aloud. It's ultimately on you to tell the tale.

## Now it's time to make a story

Now after reading and learning all of this, do some brainstorming and try to make a story. Tell it to someone else and ask them for feedback. You can also send this blog post to someone else to learn it together and make stories to tell to each other and give each other feedback.
