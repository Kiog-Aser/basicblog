Introducing the Pareto Principle and how you can use it to benefit in your daily life!

## The Pareto Principle

The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is a concept that can be applied to various aspects of life. This principle states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small percentage of inputs account for the majority of outputs. This will be a small blog post, but I hope you still get some value out of it!

## History

The principle is named after Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist who observed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by just 20% of the population. This principle has since been observed in a variety of contexts, such as business, economics, and personal productivity.

## Usage

In business, the Pareto Principle can be used to identify the most important tasks or customers. For example, a company may find that 80% of its revenue comes from just 20% of its customers. By focusing on those key customers, the company can maximize its profits and improve customer satisfaction.

The Pareto Principle can also be applied to personal productivity. By identifying the 20% of tasks that yield 80% of results, individuals can prioritize their time and focus on what truly matters. This can lead to increased efficiency and a greater sense of accomplishment.

Another application of the Pareto Principle is in time management. By focusing on the most important tasks first, individuals can avoid wasting time on low-value activities. This can help them achieve their goals more quickly and with less stress.

## Variation

It's important to know that these principle comes with variations, like 90/10 or 70/30. This could change based on situations or on personal preferences. However, the idea isn't changing, you still want to locate the 10%, 30% or 20% and focus more on these actions.
