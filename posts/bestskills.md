## My favourite skills to learn as a teen

In this blog post I will show you my favourite 5 skills to learn as a teen, how to find one that suits you best and what defines a good skill to learn. Based on all these criteria you will find the perfect skill for you to learn. I will also have a PDF summary with some checklists of this blog which you will be able to download for FREE.

## What defines a good skill?

A good skill has 5 criteria, if the skill ranks high in all 5 it's a good skill to learn.

### **The 5 criteria:**

**Sustainability:** a skill must be sustainable.

**High income:** it must be a high income skill.

**High R.O.I:** it must be a high return on investment skill.

**Highly wanted:** the skill must be highly wanted.

**Not too difficult:** the skill should not be extremely difficult to do.

## Skill #1

The first skill is **content creation**. This means creating your own content on a platform of your choice. This could be starting a YouTube channel, a blog, an Instagram page or a TikTok page. The most important part is to create content and keep going. You can read more about content creation in this post: https://blog.milh.tech/posts/showyourwork/.

**Skill analysis**:

**Sustainability:** 5/5 (very easy and sustainable)

**High income:** 1-5/5 (depends on how big you are and partnerships)

**High R.O.I:** 2-5/5 (depends on how successful you are, can be really high or low)

**Highly wanted:** 5/5 (this is very highly wanted by all of these platforms and their consumers)

**Not too difficult:** 5/5 (with the current available tools it's very easy to start)

## Skill #2

The second skill is **video editing**. This is a great skill to learn, but it's a bit more difficult and complex then some others on the list. This one is best if you already have a good computer and some experience.

**Skill analysis**:

**Sustainability:** 4/5 (a bit harder and less sustainable, but still very good if you like it)

**High income:** 3-5/5 (depends on how much you charge, mostly very high income)

**High R.O.I:** 4-5/5 (depends on how successful you are, can be really high)

**Highly wanted:** 5/5 (this is very highly wanted by a lot of content creators and businesses)

**Not too difficult:** 4/5 (it can be very easy, but also very complex)

## Skill #3

The third skill is **social media marketing** or **SMM**. This is a very good skill to learn with a lot of potential. If you find the right clients and you are able to work productive and efficient it's perfect.

**Skill analysis**:

**Sustainability:** 4/5 (very easy and sustainable, but it could get complex)

**High income:** 4-5/5 (depends on how big you are and partnerships, but overall very high income)

**High R.O.I:** 3-5/5 (depends on how successful you are, can be really high or more medium)

**Highly wanted:** 5/5 (this is very highly wanted by big businesses and smaller ones)

**Not too difficult:** 5/5 (with the current available tools it's very easy to start)

## Skill #4

The fourth skill is **Web Design/ Development**. This is most likely the hardest skill, but it's is higher R.O.I and income.

**Skill analysis**:

**Sustainability:** 3-5/5 (depends on your skills, projects and discipline)

**High income:** 5/5 (very high income)

**High R.O.I:** 5/5 (really high R.O.I)

**Highly wanted:** 5/5 (this is very highly wanted by a lot of people and businesses)

**Not too difficult:** 3/5 (quite difficult to start without any experience)

## Skill #5

The fifth skill is **Graphic Design**. This might be the best skill to learn, because of all the new technology and tools.

**Skill analysis**:

**Sustainability:** 5/5 (very easy and sustainable)

**High income:** 5-5/5 (depends on how big you are and partnerships)

**High R.O.I:** 4-5/5 (depends on who you are working with, but very high in general)

**Highly wanted:** 5/5 (this is very highly wanted by almost everyone these days)

**Not too difficult:** 5/5 (with the current available tools it's very easy to start)

## Bonus skill

I have a bonus skill for you: **copy writing**. This skill can also be very good if you are effective and if you know some good skills. 

**Skill analysis**:

**Sustainability:** 5/5 (very easy and sustainable)

**High income:** 4-5/5 (you can make a lot of money depending on what you make)

**High R.O.I:** 5/5 (maybe the best R.O.I possible, one email could get you a lot of sales, really a lot)

**Highly wanted:** 5/5 (this is very highly wanted by most people and businesses)

**Not too difficult:** 5/5 (with the current available tools it's very easy to start)

## How to find your perfect skill?

It's not that hard to find a skill that suits you! Here is a quick checklist to do this:

- **Personal knowledge/experience**
	- You should already have some knowledge or experience on the skill
- **Challenging**
	- The skill should be challenging for you, and keep you wanting to work
- **Fun**
	- You should enjoy doing
