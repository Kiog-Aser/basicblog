title: What a wonderful world this could be…
description: Have you recently took some time to stop doing what you were doing, and think? Think about the beauty of this world, think about what life could be, think about life’s obstacles? Most people probably haven’t done anything like that in a while, but some have. And those people might understand me more than others, but my message is for all.

Have you recently took some time to stop doing what you were doing, and think? Think about the beauty of this world, think about what life could be, think about life’s obstacles? Most people probably haven’t done anything like that in a while, but some have. And those people might understand me more than others, but my message is for all.

*A man thinking about life*

Perhaps you have read some books about masculinity, and you have heard that masculinity is all about freedom and achieving goals. It’s about living beyond your limits, working hard towards a dream and giving your deepest love to you wife.

These days a lot of people call (young) men weak. And it’s easy to say so, because they do have some kind of point. But it’s also really hard to grow up as a men nowadays, with endless distractions and false beliefs given to you. How are men supposed to know their purpose (life-meaning) when everyone is trying to tell them exactly who they are and what they should do from the moment they are born. Your parents want you to live a certain life, a friend of you has ambitions he wants you to be involved with and maybe even your teachers at school want you to go down a certain path. How are you supposed to know what you really want? How should men find out why they live, and what their purpose is?

I believe that there is hope however. I believe that we can still find meaning and find purpose in life, but I believe that it won’t be easy. Especially not if alone. We should work together and help each other, grandparents should share their wisdom to their grandchildren, parents should do the same, and a network of others should do the same. If we could create a network, a platform where like minded men will share the best knowledge they found online, or from experiences and share it with others we can truly change our lives. If we can learn from each other and help each other move forward, we can grow so much faster and better.

Now that you know my vision and dream, I would like you to start by sharing one valuable piece of information/content in the comments to others. We don’t need to be with plenty to help each other. We can start this platform and network right here, inside of the comments of this post. All you have to do is take a little bit of action today and start moving together. Everyone will find some value out of this, so why not go for it. Why not start this thing, and see just how far we can go. Start with yourself, than share it to others and see what they think.

*I believe in miracles, especially in this one. Together we can bring back real masculinity, not the toxic fake kind you see online, but the kind that works hard for his family and loves their family truly.*
