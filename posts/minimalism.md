Why we should simplify our lives, to become truly happy and live a better life.

## Introduction

Minimalism has always existed, and now it's growing faster than ever. It's becoming a new trend, and it's changing lives. In this blog post I will explain minimalism, give you actionable steps to implement it into your life and transform your life, give you habits to implement it and more. It's okay if you want to change your life after reading this, or not. You can choose and implement these things as you like.

## Understanding Minimalism

What is minimalism? Here is what I found on google: "In essence, minimalism **promotes conscious decision-making about belongings, time, energy, and relationships**. Minimalists are authentic, valuing simplicity and rejecting superficial mass consumerism. They aim to highlight the beauty, essence, and true purpose of things in their lives." Like I said, minimalism is an old concept, and it is now in our life coming back to life in 3 big forms: digital minimalism, lifestyle minimalism and environmental minimalism. You will probably be more interested in one of these, so try to get started with that one. I started with digital minimalism.

## The Benefits of Minimalism

What are the benefits, if there are any? There actually are a few benefits:

**Reduced Stress**: you can reduce stress by minimalising your life and disturbing incentives.

**Increased focus**: yes, you can increase your focus and productivity!

**Improved mental well-being**: you can improve your mental health and set your mind free.

There are even more benefits which you will find out when you start. Minimalism could also lead to financial freedom by reducing a lot of cost and reduced environmental impact.

## Decluttering Your Physical Space

How can you implement minimalism in your home? It's not that hard, remove all unnecessary furniture or items laying around, try to keep a similar theme around your house with colours and furniture style. Just try to start by cleaning a bit and picking up some things you never use. You can use the 80/20 rule or Pareto principle (find more here: https://blog.milh.tech/posts/pareto/) to filter out all unnecessary things in your house. This means you keep the 20% of things that give you 80% of your happiness, joy, productivity and relaxation.

## Streamlining Digital Clutter

Now it's time to talk about digital minimalism. The most distracting things in our lives are usually on the internet. There's an endless stream of content and distractions on the internet. We need to filter out all the crap and keep the good stuff. Let's take a look at how we can do that.

**Using a dumb phone**

I started using a dumb phone (find more info here: https://blog.milh.tech/posts/dumbphone/) and it truly changed my life. Our phones are most distracting in my opinion, that's why using a dumb phone has such great effects. You become more productive, you waste less time on your phone, you listen less to music (https://blog.milh.tech/posts/nomoremusic/) and your mental health drastically improves.

**What can we do on our PC/laptop?**

We've all heard about magic chrome extensions to improve productivity and reduce distractions. I find those don't really work, you just need discipline. If you do want to try it, these are my 2 favourites: Forest (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/forest-stay-focused-be-pr/kjacjjdnoddnpbbcjilcajfhhbdhkpgk) and Pomodone (https://pomodoneapp.com/).
I also highly recommend to improve your YouTube productivity. YouTube is full of great content, and crap. Watch this video and download all the extensions to use YouTube better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkO8g_nwlI. Also block YouTube on your phone by setting a 0 minute limit, because that's all you can do. 
Also try to delete all irrelevant apps and organise your files for better productivity.

## Cultivating Minimalist Habits

Now let's take a look at some habits you can implement in your day to day life to incorporate minimalism. You might know most of these habits.

**Meditation**

You probably know this, so no need for a lot of explanation. Just get started today with a couple of minutes and keep it going for at least 1 week.

**Gratitude Journaling**

Did you know the power of gratitude? Just by writing down a couple of things you are grateful for you can change your mindset, the things you attract and your life. Get a pen and paper and write down 5 things you are grateful for, now do this for at least 1 week.

**Time managment**

It's important to be able to manage time and not over plan your day. Schedule in some rest time and work time. Make a day plan for every day with all your to-do's and when you will do them. I usually write this every night before I go to bed.

**Setting boundaries and saying no**

To live a minimalistic life you should set clear boundaries and learn to say no to certain things. Set your boundaries and goals, and say no to things going over those boundaries or not related to your goals. This way you can cut out all the less important things and focus on what really matters.

## Overcoming Challenges

You might face some issues when choosing for a more minimalistic lifestyle. Maybe you are scared of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or you think you would have to sacrifice a lot to live like this. Believe me, your life won't be that different. It just takes some time to create the perfect lifestyle and find what works best for you.

## Finding True Happiness

You can find true happiness and a purposeful life through a minimalistic lifestyle. You can go back to the essence of your existence and live the life you were meant to live. 

## Conclusion

So, there you have it—minimalism, a timeless concept making a resounding comeback in today's fast-paced world. As we've journeyed through the various facets of minimalism, you've discovered not just a trend but a transformative way of life.

Minimalism, at its core, encourages conscious choices about our possessions, time, energy, and relationships. It's about embracing authenticity, simplicity, and rejecting the shallow allure of mass consumerism. Whether you're drawn to digital minimalism, lifestyle minimalism, or environmental minimalism, the path you choose is uniquely yours.

You've seen the benefits that minimalism can bring, from reduced stress and increased focus to improved mental well-being. It's a journey that can lead not only to personal growth but also financial freedom and a reduced environmental footprint.

Implementing minimalism begins with decluttering your physical space, guided by the wisdom of the 80/20 rule or Pareto Principle. By keeping the 20% that brings you 80% of joy, productivity, and relaxation, you pave the way for a simpler, more purposeful life.

In the digital realm, you've explored strategies to streamline your online presence. Consider adopting a "dumb phone" for heightened productivity, and exercise discipline alongside tools to manage digital distractions.

Cultivating minimalist habits, such as meditation, gratitude journaling, effective time management, and setting boundaries, can further enrich your journey. These habits empower you to focus on what truly matters and enhance your well-being.

Challenges may arise along the way, like the fear of missing out or the misconception that minimalism requires significant sacrifice. However, remember that minimalism is about finding what works best for you and creating a lifestyle aligned with your values.

Ultimately, a minimalist lifestyle isn't just about having less; it's about rediscovering the essence of your existence and uncovering the true happiness and purpose that lie within. As you embark on this journey, know that it's not about changing your life entirely but rather about simplifying it, allowing you to lead a life in harmony with your authentic self.

The choice to embrace minimalism is yours, and it's perfectly fine if you choose to take small steps or leap into the world of simplicity. May your journey towards true happiness through minimalism be filled with fulfillment, purpose, and contentment.
