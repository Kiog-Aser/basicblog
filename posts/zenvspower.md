After reading about power and zen, here's the difference.

## Zen

Zen is the art of nothing. It's thinking nothing, feeling nothing and doing nothing. It's peace and people say it's the place where all Buddhas live.

## Power

Power is not much like zen. It's about controlling others, controlling yourself and winning from others. You make yourself stand out, you seem greater and stronger than others, you are more powerful. You want control and strength. Most of the time you judge, you think and you feel.

## Clearly there's a big difference

If you for some reason didn't realise already, there's a big difference between zen and power. Power can be gained sometimes by clearing the mind and taking some time to think, but there's not much zen in power, and not much power in zen.

## Read more

If you are interested in reading more, read the 'book of nothing' about zen and the famous '48 laws of power' if you want to learn about power.
