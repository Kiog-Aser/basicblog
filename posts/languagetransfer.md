## My personal experience:

I've been learning Spanish with Language Transfer, and I'm really loving it. It's an app that lets you learn in your own time, and it makes it so easy to learn new words or phrases without even realizing it.

One of my favorite elements about Language Transfer is that it feels so organic and realistic. It's not like a traditional study tool, where you feel like you're being tested on every word; instead, new words come up as they would in normal conversations—you just pick them up naturally as part of the flow. After just a few lessons, I found myself able to construct sentences that I never thought possible.

## Language Transfer method:

The app uses a process called "language transfer" to help you learn Spanish (or another language). It's based on the idea that your brain is good at finding patterns—so if you can find patterns in the language you're trying to learn, it'll make it easier for you to remember it.

Language Transfer works by linking English and Spanish, because they both come from Latin. They learn a lot by linking the languages and after 3 lessons I already realized how much Spanish I could speak by knowing English.

## Other apps:

I've tried some other apps like Duolingo, wich I personally would recommend after Language Transfer. Most other apps focus on learning and memorizing some basic sentences. This can be a very good way to learn a language for someone, but I find it way easier using language transfer's method. I simply love the way the lessons are constructed. Most other apps are also not really free, language transfer is completly free and offers 8 languages. Other apps may offer more languages, but those apps are usually full of ads and tricks to make you buy their premium version. The reason I like Duolingo is because it's almost completly free and very good to learn a language slowly building your skills.

## Just try it!

I've tried some different language learning apps, and most of them have been pretty disappointing. But I'm so glad that I gave Language Transfer a shot!

It really is as easy as they say it is — you just download the app, choose your language, and follow along with the lessons (which are audio lessons of a teacher and a student, usually less than 10 minutes). And then you're done! Just try to do one lesson (or more) every day.

The best part? It doesn't matter if you've never studied a foreign language before or if you already speak it fluently—Language Transfer makes it easy for anyone to learn another language and build confidence in their ability to communicate in it.
