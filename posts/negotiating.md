A full guide to negotiating, inspired by the book 'Getting to yes!'

## How to Negotiate to Agreement

This will be a full guide to become a great negotiator, inspired a book 'getting to yes!' I hope you learn something about negotiating!

## Don't Bargain Over Positions

In negotiations, often people take a position. An example is customer and a shopkeeper of a secondhand store: the customer wants to pay the least possible, the shopkeeper wants the most he can get. This will lead to a useless negotiation where they just want to stick to their position and don't want to find an agreement based on logical facts or criteria. It's important to negotiate using some basic facts to determine for example a price for something. When you're arguing about positions, you're just trying to convince each other you're right. This won't lead to an agreement and will get even worse when there are multiple parties negotiating. This is simply not an effective way of negotiating, so try to stop doing it!

## Seperate the People from the Problem

It's hard to deal with a problem without misunderstanding each other, getting angry or upset, and taking things personally. This happens because people don't seperate the people from the problem, they see the people as a part of the problem. You should actively try to seperate the people from the problem and maybe even tell them before you say anything that you don't want to talk about them, but only about the problem. You should try to be clear and focussed on the problem. Try to put yourself in their shoes and be carefull with what you say. Try to talk about both you points of view and what your problems are, so you don't get confuse the people and the problem. Also try to make the other person 'save-face' try to be the one who gets offended instead of them and give them a good name and reputation to live up to. Allow the other side to let off steam, and calm down. You don't want to negotiate while someones mood is having a big impact on what he/she is saying. Don't react to personal things that have nothing to do with the problem. Try to speak about yourself, not about them to make them feel less 'attacked'.

## Focus on Interests, Not Positions

Now it's time to go deeper into the positions. Try to find common interests and focus on those to reach agreements. You should try to get to know the other person and their interests, not their position. If you know their interests, you can find an agreement with common interests. Be hard on the problem, and soft on the people.

## Invent Options for Mutual Gain

Try to actively brainstorm and find multiple ideas to solve your problem.

A great way to find options for mutual gain is by organising a brainstorm session with you side, and eventually with both sides. You have to have a clear purpose and goal before brainstorming, then choose some participants and start brainstorming. Here is a chart for inventing mutual gain:

Change you perspective and try to look for solutions from different angles. You could also use shared interests to find mutual gain.Try to make the decision easy by giving clear options for action.

Insist on Objective Criteria
Try to analyze a problem and solution based on objective criteria. You can find objective criteria based on fair standards: market value, costs, moral standards, tradition, etc. Try to find a good standard and analyze the problem and your solution based on this standard and reconsider if it's a fair agreement.

Develop you BATNA
If you're having trouble agreeing, you should always have a BATNA. BATNA stands for Best Alternitve To Negotiated Agreement. You want to protect yourself and be able to step out of an agreement and go for your BATNA when needed. Try to always have a BATNA ready before negotiating. Your BATNA could even help you in the negotiation, giving you an option to treathen going for your BATNA instead of accepting their offer.

Conclusion
This was the guide on negotiating, always remeber that the best way to learn is by doing. You have to start using these principles when you negotiate. Negotiating can be hard, but you can simplify it and focus on the other side and their point of view. Just practise these things and learn while doing!
