In this blog you will learn how you can fix your mindset today, forever. How you can grow the biggest winner mindset ever. You will learn about 'the secret', about believing and the power of thoughts. After this blog you will have all you need to change your mindset and your life forever. The guide will be split in a couple of key points like 'health' or 'wealth', but you could implement these things everywhere in your life.

## What is a mindset

Before we can fix our mindset, we need to know what your mindset is.
You might have heard before that your mindset is how you think about things and if you are more positive or negative. This is a very small basic idea of mindset, I believe mindset is way bigger than that. **I believe your mindset are all your thoughts, how you feel and how you look at life.** I will explain why I believe this and give more info on these things. **You don't just have a growth mindset or a fixed mindset, mindset is more complex and dynamic.**

You can look at mindset like this triangle:

Your experiences reinforce your beliefs. Your beliefs drive your actions and your actions produce your results. Mindset is not just being positive or negative, it's way deeper than that. Your mindset starts with your identity and experiences. 

A lot of people fail to achieve their new goals every year, because they change their actions without changing their beliefs and identity. **You need to start by changing your foundation, before you can change your actions.** You will never be able to stay consistent at going to the gym, if you don't believe you are a healthy person who goes to the gym. It's important to start by changing your mindset and your beliefs before changing your actions.

## Clearing your mind

Before we can start with the next parts, we need to be able to clear our mind and give it some rest. Our mind is highly over stimulated in the modern day with a lot of distractions. We can calm our mind down with a couple of easy to implement concepts. 

**Meditation:** we all know mediation, look up an online guided meditation today and start. Starting today, practice at least 3 minutes of meditations per day.

**Dopamine detox:** remove all distractions and live in peace with nature. Delete distracting apps, or even stop using a smartphone for a week. This will remove the over stimulation of your mind and bring peace into your life.

**Gratitude:** practising daily gratitude will help you a lot, to change how you look at your life. Gratitude is very important when changing your mindset.

## The law of attraction

Have you ever heard of the law of attraction? This is a big law in nature, like gravity. This law is the key to changing your life through your mindset. The law works mostly with your thoughts, what you think about most is what you attract. If you think about all the good things you want to receive, you are way more likely to receive them. This law works with some complex type of quantum physics. 

## Wealth

How can you use your mindset to receive infinite wealth. It's not that hard, but you need to start small. The most important thing is that you need to feel good about money. Every time you talk about money you should start to feel good. Money must be a positive thing in your life. If not, you will never get money. After feeling good about money, start to visualise yourself with a lot of money start to imagine who it will be like, how you will feel and what you will do. Visualisation is one of the best ways to turn your dreams into reality. Be grateful for all wealth you have and even the wealth you will receive. Say something like 'I am wealthy' daily.

## Health

Health is not much different. Feel healthy, be grateful for your health. Visualise yourself with perfect health. Imagine your life like that, feel how you would feel, do what you would do and enjoy it. Believe that that's you, say things like 'I am healthy' every day. Feel good, and do the actions to improve your health. Remember to first change your beliefs and identity by saying the things I mentioned. Be grateful and feel good, and you will receive.

## The rest of your life

Everything I mentioned works for the rest of your life too. Feel good and be grateful, visualise what you want and take actions. Even for relationships, truly imagine yourself with your dream partner, how you would feel and be grateful for that. 

## The secret

The things I mention are way better explained in the book 'the secret' by Rhonda Byrne. This book covers it all about the law of attraction, gratitude, visualisation and implementation of all of these things into your life. I really recommend the book, if you want it you can buy it here: https://amzn.to/3RS0UQX
