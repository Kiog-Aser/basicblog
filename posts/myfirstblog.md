In this post, I'll talk about my blog, what I'll post, and some basic ideas.

## About the blog

I plan to categorize my blog posts into General (like this post), Books (about books I like), and Projects (about projects I'm working on). As I post more and get new ideas, I might add more categories. Although I'll try to add separate pages filtering posts by categories in the future, I'll start with the basics and keep it simple for now. I recently added pagination to the homepage, which took 30 minutes and some help from ChatGPT. Although improving the site itself will take some time, it'll eventually grow and become more functional.

## About me

You might have seen my website and noticed that I don't talk too much about myself. This is because I want to go deeper into that with my blog, talking about my daily life and what I'm doing. Currently, I'm learning Spanish with Language Transfer (I highly recommend their app) and plan to write a post about it soon. I'm also getting back into coding by making this website.

## What I do

I play music (electric guitar and I'm trying to learn ukulele). I'm a windsurfer, and I train on Sundays, and I try to surf as much as possible in the summer. I'm also interested in languages, and I'm learning Latin at school and Spanish in my free time (with Duolingo and Language Transfer). After learning Spanish, I plan to learn more French. I'm also trying to read one book every week.

## Why I started the blog

A couple of days ago, I watched a YouTube video about "Things to do instead of watching TV," and one of the suggestions was to make a website with a small blog. I loved that idea, and since I already had a couple of websites running, I combined some code and started writing. I hope to inspire people and help them become the best version of themselves with this blog.

## Goals for my blog

I'll try to post every week, preferably on Saturdays. I'll add a quote to every blog from a book I read that week or that I just saw somewhere. <a href="https://latijnisfijn.eu/motivation/motivation.html" target="_blank">(I also have a website full of quotes.)</a> You can comment on this quote. I'll post about something I did, something educational, a book I read, or just something I like.

This quote is about specializing and focusing on important things. The fox is distracted with a lot, while the hedgehog specializes in what matters.
