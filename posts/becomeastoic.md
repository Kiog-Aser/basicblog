## Introduction

In this short blog post I will explain the basics of stoicism to you and why I think we should all become stoics. If you like it, please share the post with someone else who would like it! You can share your opinion in the comments.

## What is a stoic?

First let me explain **stoicism** and being a **stoic**. Stoicism is really going back to basic, **questioning** everything around you and living your own life. It's how **ancient Greek philosophers** lived and what some people in the modern day call **'real thinkers'**. When you question everything when you really think about things and do the things your really enjoy, you can live a life of true greatness and happiness. 

## Why would you become a stoic?

Because you want to take back control and live a minimalistic life focusing on the things that truly matter. You don't want to be **endlessly distracted** by modern day inventions, you just want to live a basic life doing things you enjoy. You want to live in a harmony with nature and the people around you. You want to achieve your **true potential**, and therefor you **question and rethink** everything you do or see.

## The Modern Day

In the modern day we are pushed and pulled into multiple different directions before we can even realise it. **We are given dreams and entire life plans when we are young.** We are getting **desires** left and right, which are more often then not irrelevant to our true purpose. But we can't find our **purpose** because it is covered by modern desires and distractions. We need to go back to things that make us happy, and sometimes just sit in an empty room to think. **Imagine working a job that makes you want to wake up early, making a lot of money out of it but not even caring about that because you are doing what you love. That's how life is supposed to be, not like most of us live in the modern day.**

## Stay inspired

To help you stay inspired I have started a **stoicism Instagram account** where I post daily quotes and some reels. You can find it here: https://www.instagram.com/dailystoicist/. 

## Quote

I think it is only appropriate to end with a stoic quote:

### "It is difficulties that show what men are."
~Epictetus
