I tweaked my browser to be next-level productivity mode. I basically made it impossible to distract myself and spend time on useless dopamine things. Do you want to know the best part? It takes only about 10 minutes to set up. **_10_ MINUTES.** That’s all to change your life an make your more productive for possibly the rest of your life. Let me show what I did and how you can do it.

# 1. Adding redirects.

The first thing I did was adding redirects. I basically thought of possibly distracting sites and added a redirect to instantly redirect them to web page I built to remind me to stay productive. I used a chrome extension for this that’s free and available for everyone and (almost) every browser. To make it even easier for you, I will give you the link to the extension, and I simple file you just need to import to get all of my redirects instantly. This step might just be the most powerful one.

# 2. Going for a minimalistic theme.

The second thing I did was ‘installing’ a minimalistic theme for my browser. Accept there is not much installing, all you have to do is install another chrome extension and tweak it how you like it. If you make it look minimalistic like mine, you will have a more relaxed experience when opening your browser, and you won’t get a sh*t load of distractions.

This is how my browser looks now:

My browser

As you can see, it looks clean and simple, not much happening. This allows me to simply go where I want to go and do what I want to do/must do.

# 3. Extra steps

If you did the first two steps, you will probably already be 3 times more productive and get way less distracted, but to really takes things to the last and final level, there are a couple of extra things you could do.

You could install the Forest chrome extension and add a very long block list. Then when you ‘plant a tree’ all of these sites will be blocked.

Another thing I recommend is deleting as much apps on your device as possible. Less is more, more work at least in this case. Keep what’s necessary and remove the distractions.

The last thing you could do is disable incognito mode so you can’t work your way around everything you just made. This is quite difficult and probably requires some research. For chrome it should be well documented, for firefox aswell I think but others are harder to find. However, this won’t really make too much impact if you still have other browsers where you didn’t do all these things.

# How to set everything up

Now that you know exactly what you are going to do, let’s make it as easy as possible to setup.

Step 1) Download all mentioned chrome extensions.

[Redirector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd)

[Theme changer (bonjour)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bonjourr-%C2%B7-minimalist-sta/dlnejlppicbjfcfcedcflplfjajinajd)

[Forest](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/forest-stay-focused-be-pr/kjacjjdnoddnpbbcjilcajfhhbdhkpgk)

Step 2) Setting up the redirector.

Now let’s start by setting up the first extension, the redirector. Like I promised, I am going to make it very easy. Just click on the extension, go to settings and than click on import. Make sure to download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aaPl4JGn_Ay2gBq-35DHPrJBHKqAJ6kr/view?usp=sharing) and import it. Now you should have something like this:

How your redirector should look

In order to add new redirects, just duplicate one and change the old redirect url with the one you would like to add. All of these urls will redirect to [this webpage](https://focus.milh.tech/), if you want to redirect to a different webpage, just look for that url and replace it with one you would like to use.

Step 3) Changing to a minimalistic theme.

Now it’s time to change the browsers theme with the bonjourr extension. It’s pretty straight forward, if installed it correctly. Just open a new tab, hit the settings icon in the right bottom corner, and start changing it to how you like it. I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qp7siYTlF8) for my theme, and changed the unsplash image theme to this one: 21418908. This is how your settings menu should look:

Example settings menu open

Step 4) Additional steps.

Now to go further, you can use the Forest extension and add a blocklist, to block certain websites. Just open the extension, click on settings and go to blocklist, now insert all the urls you want to block one by one.

For deleting apps on your device, I hope you know how to do that. I can’t give one universal way of deleting apps which would work for Windows, Max, ChromeOS and Linux. Just look it up if you don’t know it already.

And if you want to go all the way, look up how to disable incognito mode in your browser and try to do it. This way you can’t cheat your way around all the previous steps. I managed to disable incognito on brave after a few attempts, for other browsers it should be easier.

# Now enjoy!

Now it’s time to enjoy your minimalistic, productive browser. I hope this wasn’t to long or difficult to understand. Thank you for reading and have a great day.
